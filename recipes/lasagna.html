        <li>1 onion, peeled and chopped finely</li>
        <li>1 red chili, seeded and chopped</li>
        <li>2 1/4 lb (1 kg) lean ground beef</li>
        <li>a tbsp (15 ml) tomato paste or ketchup</li>
        <li>2 lb (900 g) canned chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>2 tbsp (30 ml) butter, for greasing</li>
        <li>1 box of ready-to-cook lasagna sheets</li>
        <li>5 oz (150 g) cheddar cheese grated for the topping</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Cheese Sauce</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1/3 cup (75 g) butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (75 g) flour</li>
        <li>3 1/2 cups (825 ml) milk</li>
        <li>12 oz (350 g) cheddar cheese grated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400&degF</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pan and cook the garlic, onion and chili over medium heat. Cook for 5 minutes until soft.</li>
        <li>Add the beef and cook on high heat for 3 to 4 minutes until the beef is brown.</li>
        <li>Add the ketchup and tomatoes. Season and simmer over low heat for at least an hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the cheese sauce. Put the butter and flour in a pan, and cook on medium heat, stirring for 1 to 2 minutes. (This is called a roux and will help to thicken the sauce.)</li>
        <li>Gradually whisk in the milk. Any lumps should dissolve as the milk becomes thicker. Stir for 4 to 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste and season with salt and pepper, then add the cheese. Mix well until the cheese dissolves.</li>
        <li>Grease a large lasagna dish with butter.</li>
        <li>Then lay about 4 pasta sheets on the bottom of the dish. (Break a sheet up and use the pieces to fill  in the gaps - this applies all the way through.)</li>
        <li>Spread 3 tbsp (45 ml) of meat sauce over the pasta and repeat with the cheese sauce.</li>
        <li>Assemble your next layer of pasta over the cheese sauce and repeat the process. You should be able to assemble 3-4 layers of pasta, depending on the size of your dish.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Cook in the oven for 35 to 45 minutes unitl golden brown.</li>
    </ol>
    <P>Lasagna will keep assembled and uncooked in the refrigerator for 2 days. It will keep cooked and refrigerted for 3 days. To reheat, place in the oven at 300&degF for 15 minutes.</P>
